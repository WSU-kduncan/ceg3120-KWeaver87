### Setup

- how to get an API
- where to put it to work with the code
- dependencies (what packages need to be installed to run the code)

### Usage

- with your changes to the code in place, describe
- what commands you can type in your Discord server
- what response this will provide (from your bot)

### Research

- you may have realized that it is lame that it only runs when you run the program.
- In the real world, things are "always on", not waiting for Bob to turn his PC on and make sure the program is running.
- Research some possible solutions that would solve this, and discuss why you think it would work.
